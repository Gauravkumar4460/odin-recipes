    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gajar ka halwa, also known as Gajrela, is a traditional North Indian dessert.</p>
    <p> It's a sweet pudding made by simmering grated carrots with milk, sugar, ghee, and spices. The dish is then scented with cardamom powder and garnished with chopped nuts. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 gm carrot</li>
        <li>1/2 tin condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamon powder</li>
        <li>3/2 teaspoon ghee</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chpped nuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First rinse 650 grams carrots (8 to 9 medium-sized tender, juicy carrots or 6 to 7 long carrots) a few times in water.</li>
        <li> Next, grate the carrots with a box grater or in a food processor. You can measure the grated carrots with a standard measuring cup and you will need about 4 to 4.5 cups of grated carrots.</li>
        <li> In a heavy kadai or wok, add all of the grated carrots.</li>
        <li>Pour in 4 cups full-fat milk. Switch on the burner.</li>
        <li>Mix the grated carrots and milk together.</li>
        <li>Cook this mixture on a low-medium heat. After a few minutes, the milk will begin to froth and then start slowly reducing.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring this halwa mixture often, scraping the sides of the kadai to remove the evaporated milk solids. Stir the milk solids into the cooking mixture. </li>
        <li>Cook the carrot and milk mixture until the liquid is reduced by 75%.</li>
        <li>Add 4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter). Note that some milk will be there when you add the ghee. </li>
        <li>Mix very well.</li>
        <li>Next, add 10 to 12 tablespoons sugar, or to taste.</li>
        <li>Add cardamom powder – 5 to 6 green cardamom pods powdered finely in a mortar-pestle, or about ½ to 1 teaspoon pre-ground cardamom powder.</li>
        <li>Mix very well.</li>
        <li>Continue to simmer on a low flame, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Simmer till the gajar ka halwa mixture starts to thicken and reduces more. Stir at intervals.</li>
        
    </ol>
